# Weather Data Management System
Developed a Python-based application to fetch real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and store it in an SQLite database.
The system parses and archives weather information, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, for multiple cities, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.
This project demonstrates proficiency in API integration, data processing, and database management.
